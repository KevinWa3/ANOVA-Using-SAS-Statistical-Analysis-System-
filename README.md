# ANOVA-of-SocioEconomic-Status-Using-SAS-
ANOVA of Socio-Economic Status Between Continents Using Statistical Analysis System (SAS).<br /><br />
Are there statistically significant differences in socio-economic status between continents (not including Antarctica) as defined by the four indicators: CO2 production, gross national income by capita (GNI), life expectancy, and human development index (HDI)? <br /> <br />
The correlation of HDI with the other three indicators was greater than 0.85 and thus, I mainly focused on HDI as a composite indicator. ANOVA with Welch Adjustment and post-hoc Tukey revealed that Europe and Africa are statistically significantly different (alpha=0.05) from the other continents with Europe having the highest mean HDI and Africa the lowest. There was no statistically significant difference between the other four continents: Asia, North America, South America, and Oceania. <br /> <br />
